## **Dataset Overview**  📊
We are working with **the New York City Airbnb** dataset, which includes details about Airbnb listings across New York. The dataset contains valuable information such as neighborhood, price, room type, and availability of the listings.

To better understand the dataset, I highly recommend checking the full description and metadata on **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vrindakallu/new-york-dataset)**. There you will find more details about the data, including the meaning of each column and how the dataset was collected.
